# Case Study: Apple Incorporated  Artificial Intelligence Into Useful Daily Life

## Overview and Origin
This case study focuses on Apple Inc. and it's artificial intelligence (AI) relationship with consumers. 

Name of company
Apple Incorporated (Inc).  

Apple Inc. was incorporated in 1975. The founders of the company were 26 year old Stephen G. Wozniak and his former high-school classmate Steve Jobs (then 21 years old). With the invention of the first computer (the Altair 8800) by Ed Roberts, Stephen G. Wozniak aspired to build his own computer, which ultimately lead to the idea for the company [2]. His dreams became a reality in 1975 when he decided to partner with his friend Steve Jobs. Working out of the Jobs family garage, the two decided to name their company Apple. They did not have a lot of funding, relying on Jobs selling his Volkswagen minibus and Wozniak selling his programmable calculator to fund their project. A circuit board was the result of their efforts. However, "in 1977 Jobs insisted on the creation of a stand-alone machine in a custom-molded plastic case, in contrast to the forbidding steel boxes of other early machines" [1].

This apple II also offered a colour display and other features that made Wozniak's creation the first microcomputer that appealed to the average person.  Commercial success was achieved through Jobs developing a professional management plan and by gaining substantial funding from investors. Initial investors included the following: (1) Regis McKenna, a well-known  public relations specialist for semiconductor industry to represent the company; (2) Michael Markkula, 
a wealthy veteran of the Intel Corporation who became Apple's largest shareholder and an influential member of Apple's board of directors [1]. "Wozniak also contributed to the growth of the company by inventing a disk controller that allowed the addition of a low-cost floppy disk drive that made information storage and retrieval fast and reliable with the ability to store and manipulate data - this was a game changer in the industry" [1]. Between the two of them, Jobs and Wozniak successfully launched the company and the Apple II became the computer of choice for legions of amateur programmers.

Present day Apple has 6 investors, with Berkshire Hathaway and Microsoft being the most recent investors. It has raised a total of $375M across 2 funds, with their latest fund being European tet fund. Additionally, Apple has 29 investments and generates revenue through its services category, which includes advertising services on apple Platforms and third-party licensing deals,
as well as the "Apple Care Brand" (Crunchase. Apple.). 

## Business Activities
Apple was the first company to launch an AI powered ,voice controlled, digital assistant  called Seri in 2011, which revolutionized the technological market [4]. More recently, it added to thier AI Arsenal with the purchase of a Canadian startup, Darwin AI [4]. This type of acquisition is not the first of it's kind to Apple. Acquisitions such as this have happened throughout the last decade  as Apple created an arsenal of high tec talent, highly advanced research, and those with AI PhDs and doctorials (from other companies and competitors), which gave them a competitive edge [4]. In the acquisition of Darwin, Apple has replicated this strategy by bringing in more machine learning PhDs, doctorials, and highly specialized AI experts and making them very senior in the organizational structure [4]. 

What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?

One of the specific problems that the company is trying to solve is in the area of neupr-networking. The Darwin acquisition brings talent with expertise in shrinking down neuro-networks into a smaller size so that it runs more efficiently on the iPhone, iPad verses the cloud (so more privacy). Having the capability to shrink neuro-networks (using generative synthesis)  in this fashion will bring the AI technology to the Apple customer's fingertips [4]. 

So you may be asking who are Apple's intended customers. They are primarily in the consumer, small and mid-sized business, education, enterprise and government markets. The Company sells its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force. Apple also employs a variety of indirect distribution channels, such as third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. During 2023, the Company’s net sales through its direct and indirect distribution channels accounted for 37% and 63%, respectively, of total net sales.   No information about the market size of these set customers could not be found during the time allocated to this analysis [5]. 

Besides this primary classification, Apple also explicitly targets professionals working in specialized software like music, video, photography and all kinds of 
design careers. These working professionals prefer Adobe’s Final Cut, Photoshop and related editing software which work well with Macbooks and IPads than other operating systems. Even better, business professionals prefer Apple products such as iPods and Macbooks for their day-to-day work. Products like iPads and Macbooks are lighter and portable, so they are often selected by students (upper-class), educational institutions and teaching [6].

Apple offers the following solutions to its customers: a better user experience, continuous innovation, hardware, software, and services integration, branding 
excellence, ecosystem lock-in, effective supply chain management, strategic partnerships, and long-term vision" [7]. According to Innovation Copilots (June 13, 2023)Some of the unfair advantages that Apple utilizes are the following: 

		1. "Apple wage war on hardware and chip design. They don't manufacture 100% of their component, and some mission-critical ones are usually subcontracted 
		to Samsung or Sony (screens, displays, cameras), but still, they master their hardware architecture from top to bottom. And they have years (decades by Intel standards now) of advance in chip design with their "M" and now "R" series.

		2. Unique OS capabilities honed on many different form factors. From the watch to the traditional computer, the TV box, the car, or the tablet, Apple 
		has unique skills in creating the core software layer for an incredible number of form factors, usages, and hardware. And it isn't easy to come up with many companies that could beat them at offering a more robust developer platform to produce software and content. This is a very short list of two names. Microsoft and Google. Both of them without the same chip design integration as Apple, for now.

		3. A robust network effect with their large community of developers. Another older key advantage Apple has invested tons of time and money into is certainly its developers' community.

		4. The timing might be rather smart. Given all of the above, Apple might be earlier than usual to the market, but not too early. If only because they have at least six months before shipping anything, and they probably secured many major content producers a year ago or so (we only know about Disney for now). In any case, the message has been vastly broadcasted. This is a first iteration for early adopters, a launching pad that should (will?) open the door to more mass-consumer versions down the line.

		5. With AR above VR, the positioning of the experience is aggressively smart. Not forcing everyone to adopt a central 'metaverse' as a hub to do anything with the device, but a simple OS that can be shaped to multiple usages, many of them in AR and not forced VR, is interesting. Zuckerberg politely dumped the idea of people alone on their couches after Apple's keynote, but forcing everyone into a dystopian and cartoonish virtual world seems way more difficult to swallow. And let's not forget that Apple keeps on invalidating Meta's business model (high-level privacy, no activity tracking beyond what the OS requires to function, etc.). 

		6. Worst case scenario, it's an affordable loss for Apple. Probably the smartest thing to consider is that if anything goes as Apple is currently planning, this device will only add 0.1% to its total turnover. Apple has less at stake here than Meta. The Vision Pro can just become a Mac Pro-category device that will give 100 or 300K units to the creative industry every year, and nothing bad will happen for the trillion-dollar market cap company. Cook's ego will be bruised for sure, but he doesn't seem to be the type that would care much" [8]. 


Apple currently uses 44 technology products and services including HTML5, jQuery, Google Analytics according to G2Stack, BuiltWith, which include Viewport Meta, Iphone/Mobile Compatible, and domain Not Resolving. They are actively using 86 technologies for its website, according to Apple's upcoming releases include the Vision Pro mixed-reality headset, Apple GPT AI model, Apple Watch Series 10 with MicroLED display and blood pressure monitoring, new iPads with M3 chip, and the AirPods 4 with ANC feature [9].  

## Landscape
Apple is in the field of consumer electronics software services, computer software, and online services [10]. Major trends and innovation of this field over the last 5 - 10 years include the following: smartphones and the 5G revolution, electric vehicles and self-driving cars, wearable technology, AI, augmented reality (AR), voice recognition technology, The Internet of things (IoT) and cloud computing technology. Their specific trends and innovation of this field includes the iconic iPhone, which is an innovation that became an integral part of many people's lives because of how it replaced most devices users use every day. The iPhone introduced not only the idea of a pocketable, wireless phone for communication but also acted as a replacement for other things [11].

Apple entered several new categories over the past 10 years but none were more landscape-shaping as the iPad. An instant hit, the iPad took the iPhone's 3.5-inch screen and super-sized it to 9.7 inches to make reading, watching movies, and surfing the web easier on the eyes. Additional innovations recently include the following eight items unveiled in December of 2023: Apple Vision Pro mixed reality headset, Apple 15-inch Macbook Air is now the thinnest laptop in the world, MacOS Sonoma, new privacy settings, updates to AirPods, big upgrade to Apple TV, Apple watch OS 10, iOS 17 coming to iPhones and iPads [11]. 

Other major companies in this field are IBM, Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Samsung. Apple and Samsung (also referred to as "Android" by many, consistantly rival each other in marketing adds). 

## Results
Apple's $430 billion in contributions to the US economy include direct spend with American suppliers, data center investments, capital expenditures in the US,
and other domestic spend — including dozens of Apple TV+ productions across 20 states, creating thousands of jobs and supporting the creative industry [12]. 

According to Forbs, in looking at some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success, user retention is a critical indicator of whether your business is providing real value to your users. Analyzing which features are used the most, as well as how they’re used, and optimizing for that provides a competitive advantage. If your user retention is low, you can ask for feedback to help you create better product experiences. Additional areas captured by Forbs as follows:

		1. "Time to value is an essential metric for assessing tech project success and business impact. TTV gauges the time from a project’s start to when it starts to realize tangible benefits. Shorter TTV implies efficient execution, strategic alignment and rapid value generation, fostering competitive advantage. Monitoring TTV helps leaders optimize resource allocation, enhance performance and ensure projects stay aligned. 
	
		2. "While ROI and budget adherence are critical, the satisfaction of the client (internal or external) is a key metric that should be measured when a project is delivered. The project needs to do what you set out to do according to the client, which includes staying on budget and achieving ROI. Client satisfaction should never be undervalued as a key metric for project delivery. 
	
		3. "Our objective is to delight our customers by delivering exceptional value, service and usability through our products. To evaluate how well we generate customer value, we use product-market fit, which is a dynamic process that gauges value generated through factors including customer adoption, utilization metrics and Net Promoter Scores. High product-market fit creates deep and meaningful customer value [13].
	
Comparing the current results to its competitors, Apple Inc reported Revenue increase in the 4 quarter 2023 by 2.07 % year on year. The revenue growth was below Apple Inc 's competitors' average revenue growth of 8.58 %, achieved in the same quarter. And according to a report in CSI Market, Apple is valued at over $3 trillion, which makes it the largest company in the world by market capitalization as of December 2023. CSI Market lists Samsung with a market cap of over $374 billion - hence they are truly another global powerhouse. The company makes up over a fifth of South Korea's GDP. It's worth noting that the bulk of Apple's sales is from its iPhones. Though Samsung's smartphones account for the largest portion of its sales, the bulk of its operating profit comes from its semiconductor business [14]. 

## Recommendations
If I had the ability to advise the company on products and services, the top recommendation would be to make future Apple products compactable with non-apple external devices. For example, as of today, if my daughter visits my house and forgets her iPhone charger at her apartment, she does't have a way to charge it with my android phone charger.  Additionally, I'd advise Apple to create a stylus for the iPhone. Offering these small, but meaningful capabilities would make it less cumbersome for iPhone users to get charges from non-Apple devices, and adding a stylus improves the functionality of the Iphone. (Not to mention that adding a stylus means bringing a tip like pen that includes internal electronic components (features include memory, electronic erasers, and pressure sensitivity that allows lighter or heavier lines depending upon how much pressure you apply). Such technologies used by the Samsung stylus, which is very popular and in demand [16]. Adding these technologies could bring additional sales to Apple by converting traditional android users over to Apple.
