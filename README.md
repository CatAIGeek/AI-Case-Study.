# AI-Case-Study
This homework activity was challenging for me as this course is the first time I've ever worked with code, GitHub, and having to "pull and push" documents from repositories.  
I received an 89 on the first attemp and I'm hoping that after taking the advise from the grader to keep the content, but to adjust the settings/spaces to give it a more professional 
look, that the document will be more readable and more like a case study than the "line by line" of each sentence that I originally submitted. Thank you all for the recommendation, as
I now understand what the final product was suppose to look like.
